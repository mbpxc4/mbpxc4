In today's class I tried to get the PostgreSQL application downloaded but for some reason it wouldn't pull up the app when it was done
downloading.  Once I get everyting figured out I will add the code from the assignment on your page and submit a new text file that
tells you what my progress is.  Sorry for the inconvenience but I will be working on it so that I can get caught up.
